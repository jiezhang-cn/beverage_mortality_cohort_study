# Associations of beverage consumption patterns, personalized fluid intake requirements with mortality risk and multi-organ health
 
Beverages are essential sources of fluid intake and may shape long-term health, yet the influence of beverage consumption patterns and inter-individual fluid requirements remains poorly characterized. Using 24-hour dietary recall data from 207,592 UK Biobank participants, we identified three predominant beverage patterns: coffee/tea-milk, sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages (SSB-ASB), and water-juice. Compared with the water-juice pattern, the coffee/tea-milk pattern was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87–0.97), whereas the SSB-ASB pattern was associated with a higher risk (HR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03–1.20). To contextualize these associations, we performed phenome-wide analyses integrating proteomics-derived organ age, multimodal health phenotypes and incident disease outcomes. The SSB-ASB pattern was consistently associated with an adverse multi-organ profile encompassing kidney impairment, poorer cardiovascular health, increased adiposity, higher lung-related diseases risk and unfavorable brain structural phenotypes. The coffee/tea-milk pattern was associated with broadly favorable cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic profiles, while alongside adverse signatures of arterial and lung health. Finally, fluid-intake achievement rate exhibited a U-shaped association with mortality, with marked heterogeneity across beverage patterns. These findings may inform more personalized dietary guidance that collectively considers beverage combinations, volume and individual fluid needs.
