# Beverage consumption with mortality risk, organ specific aging and multimodal health phenotypes
 
This study investigates the complex relationships between beverage consumption patterns and multiple health outcomes using large-scale population data from the UK Biobank cohort. We analyzed eight common beverage types (coffee, tea, low-fat and whole milk, sugar-sweetened beverages, artificially-sweetened beverages, natural fruit juice, and water) and their associations with mortality risk (external validation in the HRS and NHANES cohorts), organ-specific aging, and comprehensive health phenotypes. The research addresses critical gaps in beverage research by moving beyond simple scoring systems to personalized hydration patterns exploration, integrating organ-specific aging assessments, conducting comprehensive phenotyping across multiple biological systems, and providing undelying mechanistic insights through multi-omics approaches including metabolomics and proteomics analyses. 

This work provides evidence-based insights for personalized beverage consumption guidelines and targeted dietary interventions, particularly relevant for healthy aging strategies and health promotion across health stages.
